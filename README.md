# CSharp-example-project_
simple tic tac toe game, WIP

Coded in C#, i am trying to repurpose an older C++ program I did for my C++ course in college.
The C++ program ran in the command line, with the C# version I am attempting to add a visual interface.
In addition to the added portability of running on the Windows Universal Platform.
It's a bit ambitious and might be a little messy as I prototype/test several ideas on
my way to the road to call it "complete."

The original course project is added as "quistian2.cpp", NOTE: for the course we wrote C++ for an older "Borland" compiler, which may or not be compatible with more modern compilers.
Worked on during my free time.
